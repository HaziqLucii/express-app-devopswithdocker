This is a project from devopswithdockeruh (https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications).

I used for study purpose to demonstrate the github actions to redeploy to fly.io everytime I pushed new code.

What I did was just by adding a new job after the build, to deploy by referring to this doc :
https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/continuous-deployment-with-github-actions/
